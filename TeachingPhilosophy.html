												<h2> My Teaching Philosophy, Impacts and Influences</h2>
												
											</header>

											<h3>Teaching Philisophy and how it Links to Education Theories</h3>
											<p>My teaching philosophy and desired learning environment is to create a safe and welcoming environment where students feel comfortable learning whilst also sharing thoughts and opinions. This will be vital when creating a management plan for the food technology class. My teaching philosophy is rooted in a humanistic approach helping to promote and encourage autonomy and individuality within the classroom. Recognising each student as their own person.  It is further emphasised by social learning theory and the importance or impact of social influences on students behaviour and capacity to learn.</p>

											<p>Throughout my degree and first placement experience, I have learned and practiced many different teaching styles and strategies. The one that has stood out and I hope to better implement in my future classrooms is the behaviourist theory.  This teaching strategy surrounds the ideas that the environment or external factors directly influences oneâ€™s behaviour and attitude towards the content and learning. Throughout my high school experience, I was lucky enough to experience very supportive and comfortable environments and therefore I want to create a classroom environment that is the same. The behaviourist theory allows me to utilise positive reinforcement and ensure that the students have a more positive experience when learning at school. As well as this, there is an increase in technology, as phones and laptops become more prevalent within the school environment, that having a classroom with limited distractions allows students to feel safe to share with others.</p>
