												<h2>Introduction</h2>
												<p>Read bellow to learn more about me and my life before starting study at ACU</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>I am a 20-year-old second-year student studying at ACU. I am undertaking a double degree in a Bachelor of Teaching (Secondary) and a Bachelor of Arts (Technology) to one day become a secondary TAS teacher, specialising in Food and Textiles Technology.

 

												I grew up with many supporting individuals in my life, both my family and friends have encouraged me to undertake things that will strengthen me as a person and allow me to grow within myself. I am an avid reader, baker, and animal lover with aspirations to travel the world. My love of travel and culture has been inspired by my childhood in which I got the opportunity to live overseas in both Singapore and China. This has encouraged me to pursue a career pathway that allows me options to live and work in other places around the world, increasing my impact on others.</p>

											<h3>Makingn an Impact</h3>
											<p>Making an impact in life has always been something I have strived for, my Christian faith has allowed me to see the benefits of having a strong hope in something other than myself, strengthening my assurance that God knows my pathway in life and will support me every step of the way.
												I have always wanted to become a teacher and have been heavily influenced by my secondary school teachers as well as others who are teachers themselves. I saw the way I was impacted by my teachers in high school specifically my HSC Food Technology teacher and wanted to create the same impact on others. I want to teach in a way that makes students feel comfortable to learn, experiment within the classroom, encouraging them to become the best version of themselves with the confidence to share ideas and create opinions.</p>
